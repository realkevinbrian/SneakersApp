features to optimize my react Components

React Context

React context allows us to pass to our component tree without usign Props.

1-To use context we use **createContext** from React  
2-After initializing **createContext** with have access to 2 properties which are **Provider** and **Consumer**
3-We wrap the **Provider** around the component that we want to pass the value down.
4-Next we place the consumer in the component that we want to consume the _value_
