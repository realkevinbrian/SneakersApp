### What I learned

Bulding this Project I learned new Development Technics to solve problems in real world Projects,
I figured out that we have to first code the HTML first then style once we finished structuring all the project.

-[] My challenge was to create a cart box when once Add to Cart the cart open and add the Product to cart bucket.
-[] Creating Navbar was also challenging but in this project I figured out how to solve such a problem.


### Continued development

I would like to add a page to list all products and create Product functionality
-[]Add payments like paypal , wepay etc
